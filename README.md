# crowdfunding_back_end
Shecodes Project: Kickstarter, Go Fund Me, Kiva, Change.org, Patreon... All of these different websiteshave something in common: they provide a platform for people to fund projects that they believe in, but they all have a slightly different approach. You are going to create your own crowdfunding website, and put your own spin on it!
